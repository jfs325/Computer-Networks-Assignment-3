Keep-alive implementation - Program runtime: 0.003114 seconds

Closed-connection implementation - Program runtime: 0.001657 seconds

It seems that keep-alive protocol takes longer on average than closed connection.

This makes sense in the context of one http call. Closing the connection immediately
and only making one attempt for one http call will be faster than trying to keep the connection alive.

But if there many http calls happening, then constantly closing and reopening connections would be much
slower than the keep-alive protocol which sends over the same connection, and would open and close connections much less.
